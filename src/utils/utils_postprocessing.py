    It is only of use in case we are training a model over a synthetic dataset, so as to later compare the performance of the attained model in what regards to the similarity between the original and the trained model.

    Args:
        * vocab_size (int): Size of the synethic'data vocabulary.
        * model (AVITM): Model whose topic-word matrix is being transformed.
        * model_type (str): Type of the trained model (e.g. AVITM)
        * ntopics (int): Number of topics of the trained model.
        * id2token (List[tuple]): Mappings with the content of the document-term matrix.
        * all_words (List[str]): List of all the words of the vocabulary of size vocab_size.
